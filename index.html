                        A young Kintarō battling Namazu, 
                        in a print by Yoshitoshi
                        Kintarō <mark>(金太郎; often translated as "Golden Boy")</mark> is a folk hero from Japanese folklore.
                        [1] A child of superhuman strength, he was raised by a yama-uba ("mountain witch") on Mount Ashigara.
                        He became friendly with the animals of the mountain, and later, after catching Shuten-dōji, the terror of the region around Mount Ōe, 
                        he became a loyal follower of Minamoto no Yorimitsu under the new name Sakata no Kintoki (坂田 金時). 
                        He is a popular figure in Bunraku and kabuki drama,
                        and it is a custom to put up a Kintarō doll on Boy's Day in the hope that boys will become equally brave and strong.

                        Kintarō is said to have been born in the mid-Heian period (794–1185) and to have lived on Mount Ashigara in Sagami Province (modern-day Kanagawa Prefecture).
                        His mother was a yama-uba, a mountain witch or ogress. 
                        As a child, Kintarō was known as Sakata no Kintoki.

                        The legends agree that even as a toddler, 
                        Kintarō was active and tireless, 
                        plump and ruddy, wearing only a haragake apron with the kanji for "gold" (金) on it. 
                        His only other belonging was a hatchet (ono or masakari). He was bossy to other children (or there simply were no other children in the forest), 
                        so his friends were mainly the animals of Mt. Kintoki and Mt. Ashigara. He was also phenomenally strong, 
                        able to smash rocks into pieces, uproot trees, and bend trunks like twigs. His animal friends served him as messengers and mounts, 
                        and some legends say that he even learned to speak their language. Several tales tell of Kintarō's adventures, 
                        fighting monsters and oni (demons), 
                        beating bears in sumo wrestling, and helping the local woodcutters fell trees.
